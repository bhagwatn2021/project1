- Question #1
	Returns 0
- Question #2
Y is equal to x
		Bitwise xor value and zero returns value
	Complement mask + 1 results in an overflow so that z = 0
	The value returned, is in turn, the value supplied
- Question #3
	Y = the opposite of x which is a value, and thus 0
	Z is a mask of zeros created
	0 bitwise-or with 0 results in 0
	The opposite is returned, 1 always
- Question #4
	Return 2^(31 - n(param variable))
- Question #5
	Returns -1
- Question #6
